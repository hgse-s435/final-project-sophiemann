If they're present in other papers, that will demonstrate that there's not only a connection between those two papers, but also a trend within that time period (one year) regarding that topic (e.g. Machine learning in education, social emotional learning, peer to peer learning, etc.). This will also provide a cloud of words (a network) demonstrating how the items are connected. \n",

Since this is the first time this dataset has been examined, I hope that these methods will be good practice for me and interesting for other interested in doing corpus-related analysis, like co-word analysis or social network analysis. \n",
