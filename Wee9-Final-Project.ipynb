      "[\" Collaborative environments typically provide a medium for realizing or capturing discussion. Whilevaluable, the discussion is often decontextualized from the situation in which it makes sense. Anchoredcollaboration environments provide a mechanism for connecting collaboration to digital media content, suchas Web-based syllabi and assignment descriptions. The most significant learning context in most classes isstill the face-to-face whole class lecture or discussion. The Classroom 2000 project at Georgia Tech iscapturing classroom experiences in multiple media: audio, video, presenter's slides, presenter's whiteboardmarkings, and students' notes. By connecting the Classroom 2000 captured lectures to a persistentcollaboration space, we provide (a) a mechanism for asynchronous collaboration that is anchored in classcontexts and (b) a means for treating class activity as persistent learning medium for later comment andcollaborative extension. This paper describes a pilot study to create a collaborative discussion space anchoredin captured classroom lectures.\", ' This paper is based on the fundamental claim that one of the major roles of new media is not to deliver predigested information to individuals, but to provide the opportunity and resources for social debate and discussion. For most design problems (ranging from urban design to graphics design and software design) that we have studied over many years, the knowledge to understand, frame, and solve these problems does not exist, but is constructed and evolved during the process of solving them, exploiting the power of the \"symmetry of ignorance\" and \"breakdowns.\" From this perspective, access to existing information and knowledge (often seen as the major advance of new media) is a very limiting concept. Many social and technological innovations are limited to provide primarily better access, leading to \"consumer\" cultures. Our approach focuses and creates support for lifelong learning activities grounded in informed participation and empowerment, allowing learners to incrementally acquire ownership in problems and contribute actively to their solution. ', ' When students with varying levels of expertise collaborate on computer-based design projects, different roles for experienced and inexperienced designers often emerge. The goal of this study was to determine if students with different levels of experience, knowledge, and skill in learning through design are aware of these differences; and also if they are aware of how this variation affects their collaborative interactions. Toward this end, sixty-two fourth and fifth-grade designers with varying levels of expertise in design and programming were interviewed following their participation in a 10-week learning through design project. Students were asked to identify differences between experienced and inexperienced designers. Their responses were classified via an emergent coding scheme. Results showed that students were aware of differences not only in requisite skills, but also how these skills contributed to collaborative interactions. Students cited knowledge and interaction differences in relation to visible skills like programming more often than other meta-design skills, such as planning and project monitoring.  ', ' The Achieving High Academic Standards Project (AHAS) of the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is an ongoing in-service and dissemination project that provides an engaged-learning professional development program for sixth grade teachers using modeling tasks. The project included thirty-eight sixth grade classrooms (approximately 1000 students) in eight public school districts and three private schools throughout Illinois. The classrooms selected are all low SES, high mobility and high special education enrollments. The project provided classrooms with a new computer, pedagogy and technology for model building. The educational goals were selected to achieve the math standards of data collection, representation, and interpretation. Results indicate an actual cost, including a new computer and wiring, of $225 per student participating in the project. Teacher surveys and observation in classroom visits indicate over 80% active use of modeling software by students in modeling energy systems within their schools. Over 70% of teachers report that they will continue using the modeling software beyond the project end. The AHAS Project is a collaboration among the National Computational Science Alliance (NCSA), the North Central Regional Technology in Educational Center (NCRTEC) and the participating school districts. Funding for $0.25 million is from the ISBE. Partial funding and support are also provided by NCRTEC. ', ' In this paper, I develop strategies for designing and assessing collaborative learning environments from a knowledge integration perspective. I identify strengths and weaknesses associated with collaborative learning, linking them to the instructional approaches used in an eighth-grade science curriculum where students design a desert house. The house design activity provides a context for connecting instructional goals and technical innovations. Focusing on how students specializing in different areas can share ideas and provide feedback for each other, I show how social and technical supports can work to achieve common goals. I examine two assumptions about how an expanded repertoire of models contributes to knowledge integration. First, I provide evidence that considering more alternatives leads to improved designs only if students have a framework for organizing those alternatives and selecting between them. Then, I provide evidence that encouraging students to iteratively refine their ideas contributes to knowledge integration. Finally, I show how these cognitive goals can be pursued through social and technical innovations which seek to encourage knowledge integration by making thinking visible for students.  ', ' What is the role of a shared whiteboard in building a shared understanding of the task and its solution? Our hypothesis was that a graphical communication tool would facilitate grounding processes, i.e. the mutual understanding of one or a few utterances and thereby the construction of a shared solution. We conducted an empirical study with 20 pairs solving an enigma in a MUD environment enriched with a whiteboard. The results show that the whiteboard was used less used to disambiguate difficult concepts in conversation than as a tool for distributed regulation of the task. The graphical features of the whiteboard were less exploited thatn the fact that information displayed on the whiteboard was persistent. Subjects selected the communication medium by matching the persistency of display (how long information is displayed) with persistency of information (how long it remains valid). Their grounding behaviour also takes into account the probability that some piece of information probabilty that some piece of infornmation is misundersis misunderstood or disagreed upon. ', ' As an educational approach, Computer Supported Collaborative Learning is often interpreted as arestricted concept concerning shared knowledge acquisition rather than, more broadly, as a holistic process ofshared formation and socialization. Several aspects of learning and cases of research, however, indicate thatwe need to consider the idea of educational processes as processes of socialization, e.g. Jean Lave andEtienne Wenger (1991) who work from a concept of learning as social participation.', ' Interpretation of symbols, as well as understanding the particulate nature of matter and spatial structures are essential skills students need for solving problems in organic chemistry. However, model perception and understanding the spatial structure of organic molecules has been a source of difficulty for many chemistry students. A computerized molecular modeling (CMM)-based collaborative learning environment has been shown to be an effective means to overcome certain learning difficulties in chemistry.

However, these kinds of projects require a large amount of effort toundertake. We believe computing technology can help. Here, we examine the role of existing technology inallowing kids and elders to share historical stories. We present the results of two pilot studies. Lessonslearned for CSCL system design and classroom implementation are presented, along with future directions.', ' Recent research in CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) and CSCW (Computer Supported Co-operative Work) has provided insights into how various forms of awareness information should be computer supported to enable collaboration in distributed environments. Based on an understanding of learning as mediated by social interaction and artefacts (such as various forms of information and communication technologies), we argue that the effects of task and workspace awareness are highly situated with respect to collaborative knowledge construction. Some issues from this line of consideration are illustrated by examples gathered from designs of a distributed interactive 3D application.  ', ' Multidisciplinary teamwork in an information age learning environment poses new assessment challenges. This paper presents a study that focuses on the assessment of a learning environment in which students collaborate in multidisciplinary, geographically distributed teams. The study presents a new metric, cross-disciplinary learning, as a journey from the state of island of knowledge (discipline-centric) to a state of understanding of the goals, language, and representations of the other disciplines. The metric proposes a four-tiered classification, designed to measure the students’ evolution of cross-disciplinary learning, that is based on the perspectives of cognitive and situative learning theories.  The four tiers are islands of knowledge, awareness, appreciation, and understanding. An additional metric is based on a longitudinal assessment that tracks the programmatic changes such a cross-disciplinary education program can lead to.  The paper describes the multidisciplinary, collaborative, geographically distributed teamwork learning environment, the assessment methodology, data collection and analysis, and discusses the preliminary results. ', \" This paper examines cross-disciplinary collaboration in an online dance course in the School for the Contemporary Arts, Simon Fraser University. The course was delivered entirely online through the Lohn Lab, Centre for Distance Education at SFU. Students were from both the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Applied Sciences, which allowed for cross-disciplinary collaborative work. Most course tasks required the students to create unique human figure animations using Life Forms 3-D human figure animation software and give aesthetic critiques on the work of others. To investigate how online collaborative tasks may foster creativity, we analyzed conference transcripts, interviews, and questionnaires. Transcript analysis showed that students actively collaborated. The message exchange also revealed that the environment functioned well as a means of promoting student-centered collaboration. The insight and creativity in using Life Forms that the non-dance students contributed helped dance students free themselves from their established conceptions of dance pedagogy and aesthetics. Issues that hindered collaboration were mostly related to students' particular preferences and software problems (downloading/uploading time). The majority of students interviewed supported the online collaborative Life Forms assignment tasks, but some were negative about collaborative assignments. \", ' Zora is a narrative-based graphical multi-user environment purposefully design to help people understand and affect the ways in which identity and values are actively constructed by both an individual and a community. Zora engages young people in building artifacts as representations of their complex self and creating communities in which values and attitudes are put to the test. It supports 1) creation of a virtual city with its different spaces, objects and interactive characters, 2) communication between the users, and 3) introspection about role models, personal and community values. This paper describes the theoretical framework that conceives identity as dynamically constructed by putting together diverse and conflicting elements and values. Based on this framework, Zora’s design principles are presented, as well as preliminary results from a pilot experience in which young people used Zora to learn about identity and values in a hands-on, constructionist way. ', ' We describe how the integration of multiple computer-mediated communication and collaboration technologies can support educational activity through mentoring in a local community context. We discuss the student and mentor expectations, their ongoing relationships, and the role that technology has played throughout their interactions. ', ' Computers have not yet had the profound impact on classroom practice that has been predicted. Given the proven potential of computer-mediated instruction, what can account for the lack of progress? This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of many of the existing computer-mediated learning environments and suggests that the learning theories that lie behind them lead to designs that do not fit with nor change the basic participation structures of the classroom. We argue instead for Activity Centered Design (ACD), a model of design for Computer Supported Collaborative Learning environments, based on the following assumptions: that activity is mediated by cultural tools, that activity must be conceptualized on a number of interdependent levels, and that conceptual understanding is first established socially. We then critique our own existing learning environment, the Probability Inquiry Environment, from the ACD perspective. ', ' MIT’s System Design & Management program (SDM) is a distance education master’s degree program in engineering and management for industry employees that hopes to overcome some of the typical barriers to organizational learning. The author has collected a variety of data on the SDM program, and this paper discusses some of the results so far. Findings focus on the technology used for distance learning, the students’ ability to apply their learning in the workplace, and the difficulty for students and faculty to adapt to the distance learning setting.  ', ' Distributed computational CPSEs (Collaborative Problem-Solving Environments) offer a petri dish where we can keep records and track creative path-finding as never before. CPSEs will enable us to test hypotheses about the dynamics of creative problem-solving that could not be tested until now. ', ' Computer supported collaborative learning has the potential for driving educational reform efforts, but there are many challenges to face before achieving that vision. Two of the most critical are achieving teacher buy-in and motivating students to participate in a knowledge-building community. We have developed a new CSCL tool whose flexibility is inspiring good teachers to create exciting new collaborative learning activities, and whose persistence is an enticement to students. We are now attempting to use this tool to leverage a particular kind of educational reform goal: Achieving integration across curricular boundaries. ', ' Collaborative learning requires interaction and exchange among learners as they share experiences and solve problems cooperatively. In computer-supported distance learning classes it is often difficult to know to what extent individuals are interacting and how much they communicate with other class members. To explore intra-class interaction, social network data were gathered on the exchange of information and advice about class work among members of four distance learning classes, and the use of media for this exchange. Results present a preliminary evaluation of characteristics of the \"typical\" student’s network in these classes, including the size of the network, the frequency of exchanges, and the media used, and its relation to students sense of belonging to the class. ', ' Since 1996 the Communication Studies programme at Roskilde University (Denmark) has been offered as distance education. During the four years, we have improved our means to achieve a functioning CSCL pedagogy, developing from initially a somewhat naïve translation of face-to-face and group organized PBL to an online context, into a now rather reflected CSCL learning concept, with intensive facilitator/supervisor involvement.  ', ' The KBS Hyperbook System is a system which uses explicit conceptual models and meta data to structure and connect external data. When these external data are pages on the WWW, the corresponding conceptual model takes the role of an information index and determines the navigational structure between these pages (corresponding to one or more views on the external data). The conceptual model also serves as a schema for the integration of new pages (similar to the role of a database schema). In this paper we show how such a model can be used to support three main aspects of constructivist learning in a computer supported teaching environment, namely structural support for goal-oriented learning and projects,the integration of student projects into hyperbook based lecture material and the implementation of student annotations. ', ' Threads in a computer conferencing systems develop in seemingly unpredictable ways. Each time someone starts a new discussion or extends an existing line of thought, there is a subtle shift in the intellectual spotlight ñ a shift that influences the contribution patterns of subsequent users. Active threads may unexpectedly fade to the background, and older, inactive threads may regain centre stage. Yet within this complex ebb and flow, there are certain indicators that help predict a thread’s future. An analysis of the 1571 threads in 7 distance education conferences reveals patterns of development that can be used to statistically assign growth probabilities to individual threads. Possible applications of these findings are discussed.  ', ' We describe a web-based collaborative educational project in an under-served rural community in Northern Thailand. The rural community enjoyed high internet connectivity via a satellite internet link installed as part of a larger research endeavor directed by Seymour Papert. Project Lighthouse is exploring the role of computers in educational reform throughout Thailand. The goal of this particular pilot project was to help villagers of all ages and backgrounds gain technological fluency, cultivate a sense of ownership and mastery, and develop knowledge and pride about their cultural heritage and history while creating an on-line magazine for their village. The constructionist methodology guided our work and helped people to view themselves not only as consumers but also as producers of information. The project employed a software environment named Pluto, an authoring tool specially designed at the MIT Media Lab to support community-based collaborative electronic publishing.  ', \" As computers become integrated in our everyday lives, it is important that we do not limit computer-based collaboration to distributed settings. As the demand for collaborative applications grows, it is imperative that we investigate how to effectively support co-located collaboration and fully understand the consequences of this style of interaction. This paper presents preliminary results from a research study which examined pairs of elementary school children playing a puzzle solving game in various collaborative setups. Children's activity and engagement levels when playing on a computer with multiple input devices was compared to other traditional collaborative settings (paper-based, common desktop configuration). Preliminary qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed three main benefits of providing each child with access to a mouse and a cursor: (a) children exhibited a significantly higher level of engagement; (b) children tended to be more active; and (c) children significantly preferred playing on a computer equipped with multiple input devices and cursors.  \", ' We are investigating collaboration and learning in immersive virtual environments. Preliminary studies of 110 sixth and ninth grade students have been conducted where students worked in pairs while investigating the concept of global warming within a fully immersive, 3-D, virtual reality based model of Seattle called Global Change World (GCW). Field research being conducted during June of 1999 is expanding on these preliminary studies by seeking to identify differences in science concept learning between solitary users, paired-peer users, and agent-guided users interacting within the GCW virtual learning environment (VLE).We have observed that most students thoroughly enjoy their experiences with GCW. It is also apparent that peer collaboration plays a significant role in regards to the level of student engagement within the VLE. Therefore, we believe that the potential for GCW to facilitate valuable collaborative learning experiences in conjunction with more traditional classroom activities is great. Our continuing research is intended to focus more closely on the impact of both peer and expert-novice collaboration on the preconceived or \"naive\" scientific concepts held by students. The paper that follows describes our research to date, and will be amended to include the methods and results of our research-in-progress. ', ' This contribution analyses the arguments of students in a learning activity entitled \"Argue Graph\". This activity is intended to make students understand the relationship between learning theories and design choices in courseware development. The analysis of arguments is centered on the effects of discussion and opinion conflict on the elaboration of arguments. We then use an adaptation of a collective intelligence model to describe the knowledge flow among people and artifacts during the learning activity. Finally, the representations produced by the system, used by students to write a synthesis and by the teacher to debrief the class are analysed in relation to metacognition. We propose to consider these representations as metacognitive tools which structure the learning activity. ', ' Some student difficulties in learning science can be understood by considering the background knowledge that people necessarily assume in conversations. In learning science, students have to develop meanings and understandings that can be taken as shared in conversations. Small groups of students can be aided in their development of shareable understandings by constructing explanations of their thinking on a computer. ', ' This paper explores the idea of situated learning and the related idea of a community of practice. These ideas have had a seminal influence in the CSCL community, yet they have received little serious attention in refining their use. This paper uses material from a recently completed piece of research to reflect on the educational (mis)use of the idea of situation. It argues that the view of situation popularized in the works of John Seely Brown and others contains a moral imperative. It maintains that a better understanding of situation might be achieved by adopting a stance that does not privilege a certain type of situation above others. ', 'ons detached from practice distort or obscure intricacies of that practice\" (Brown and Duguid 1996 p59)  ', 'on and formalizations cannot be contrasted to an authentic situation as they form part of it. The appeal being made here is to describe empirically situations for learning rather than to artificially divide them between school and authentic practices. ', ' We observed eight experienced avionics technicians as they coached collaborating dyads who worked on problems in Sherlock 2, an intelligent tutoring system for avionics. Data analysis focused on: (1) defining the cognitive skill of coaching collaboration, (2) identifying cues that coaches use to detect and diagnose peer interaction impasses, and (3) specifying how coaches remedy these impasses. Coaching collaboration is an extension of the task of mentoring in one-on-one interactions. It involves three levels of diagnosis: diagnosing problems in the task situation, in students’ knowledge and problem-solving process, and in peer interactions. One-on-one instructional interactions–e.g., medical rounds consultations between an expert physician and a resident–involve only the first two levels. We describe cues that can signal to a human or automated coach that intervention is necessary and can indicate what the cause of a peer interaction impasse is. During problem solving, the avionics experts tended to focus on giving advice that would keep students on a productive solution path. They seldom addressed problems at the interaction level–e.g., by prompting a student who evidently knew what to do next to help his peer. However, experts and students used the post-practice reflective discussions to more fully address knowledge gaps, misconceptions, and interaction-level problems.  ', ' The Design Discussion Area (DDA) supports student reports to each other about their design efforts as they are learning science from design activities. Its scaffolding was designed to support both the writing of well-formed stories about their design efforts and discussion about each design effort. At their best, these discussions are a source of ideas for other students; a venue for talking science, using evidence in support of claims, getting advice, and providing explanations that others can understand; and a vehicle for some of the reflection necessary to turn one’s experiences into well-formed and well-indexed cases in one’s memory. DDA was trialed with 200 students; it was easy for students to use but it wasn’t as straightforward to integrate into classroom activities as we had supposed and didn’t provide as useful scaffolding as we had imagined. ', \" I propose here a new theoretical framework for understanding learning as a socially-grounded phenomenon based the writings of the Russian philologist, M. M. Bakhtin. Bakhtin's writings on the dialogic nature of all texts provide the basis for a new view of language, knowledge, and learning. From this perspective, learning is seen as the process of multiple voices coming into contact, both within and across speaker-produced utterances. Examples are provided of two types of studies based on such a theory of learning: studies of the appropriation of a social language and studies of speech genres. I conclude by recounting the potential advantages of adopting dialogicality as a conceptual basis for ongoing work in CSCL. \", ' This study examines the actions and discourse of students in a chemistry laboratory course as they interact with available social and material resources. In one session, students conduct wet lab experiments; in another, they use molecular modeling software. The analysis demonstrates that the features of the computer-generated representations afford conceptual discussions. The structure of the task and the available material resources in the wet lab more often result in help-seeking behavior. ', ' In this paper, we describe and evaluate a system for supporting group learning that enhances interactions among learners. To date we have constructed several systems for supporting collaborative learning. One of the aims of CSCL is to promote mutual learning through interactions and discussions among learners. Our previous experiments, however, have shown that these systems may not be so effective for supporting interactions and discussions at times. In order to enhance interactions further, a system should support externalization of each learner in an easily recognizable manner. Through such externalization, learners can actively collaborate or conflict with each other through discussions. ', ' At the center of an intellectual community, members draw upon their knowledge of shared assumptions to have nuanced discussions about complex ideas. Newcomers to the conversation, who are on the edge of this \"interpretive community,\" do not partake in the common ground necessary to join these discussions and can find themselves in a trapped state. We are designing a new kind of computationally-generated augmentation that jumpstarts the search for meaningful common ground ñ both for people trying to join an established interpretive community, and for people trying to form a new one. This paper discusses the application of this type of augmentation, called the µ -cue, to both face-to-face and on-line communities.  ', ' Earlier studies suggest that benefits may be found in chat line communication rather than high bandwidth video-conferencing conditions when considering collaborative design learning. This paper draws together studies that look at this conjecture and concludes that chat line collaboration reduces fixation in problem space exploration. This encourages the participants to explore design opportunities in a different way than graphical or video based communication.  ', ' In view of the potential of CSCL for educational innovation, this paper illuminates some aspects resisting the development of quality social interaction in pupil collaboration. A study is reported where pupils worked in small groups in computer-based classroom activity within the framework of a six year-old innovation program in a primary school. A combined ethnographic and discourse analytic model is used to describe group dynamics in four groups of pupils (aged 8-11) involved in tasks of exploratory learning. We analyzed the data taking three distinct perspectives, a personal or insiderís perspective, an interactionist perspective and a social norms perspective. The former revealed the pupil to be a person who seemed to perceive the society within which he/she was called upon to act, as a forum in which to claim and defend his/her social role. The interactionist perspective brought forward the issue of role negotiation and its overbearing presence in social exchange in the form of groupthink, role confusion and vagueness. Finally, the group and classroom social norms, which seemed to have emerged as functional within these societies, had a judgmental character. ', ' The Vicarious Learner project is investigating the role of dialogue in learning and, more specifically, how learners benefit from opportunities to \\'overhear\\' other learners. We describe evidence of such learning by students using \"vicarious learning resources\" in a computer-supported learning environment. We argue that education dialogue has properties that are different from \"everyday\" dialogue. We see educational dialogues in particular as being about the complex alignment of concepts where the participants know that an initial misalignment is fairly certain. We focus on the distinction between exposition and derivation in discourse and discuss how this might describe what happens in learning dialogues. ', ' Reviewing past events has been useful in many domains. Videotapes and flight data recorders provide invaluable technological help to sports coaches or aviation engineers. Similarly, providing learners with a readable recording of their actions may help them monitor their behavior, reflect on their progress, and experiment with revisions of their experiences. It may also facilitate active collaboration among dispersed learning communities. Learning histories can help students and professionals make more effective use of digital library searching, word processing tasks, computer-assisted design tools, electronic performance support systems, and web navigation. ', ' Designers of Internet applications and those helping others learn about the net need to understand the problems Internet newcomers face as they encounter the idiosyncratic structures that organize the networked world. As part of an ethnographic study of SeniorNet, an organization that helps seniors learn to use computers, we explore early encounters with the networked world by analyzing questions asked in introductory computer classes. These questions, grounded in newcomers’ prior experience, show how the taken-for-granted assumptions and strategies underlying successful Internet use differ from those in other domains. The questions and analysis are grouped in the following categories: identity on the Internet; boundaries and scope of the Internet; boundaries and scope of the personal computer; and organizations and providers in the networked world. ', ' Computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) offers promising innovations andtools for restructuring teaching-learning processes to prepare students for the emerging knowledgesociety. However, sufficient and reliable data have not been available concerning how thepractices of CSCL fit in different school cultures, and how teachers with varying pedagogical anddomain expertise and students with varying skills, attitudes and learning experiences are able tofunction with different network learning environments. This paper discusses the challenges ofCSCL on the basis of intensive case studies conducted in Finnish elementary and secondaryschools. The results of these studies indicate that in order to promote educational change andfacilitate practices of collaboration at school with the new information and communicationtechnology and CSCL, serious challenges have to be overcome. The analysis revealed challengesthat can be categorized according to three dimensions: pedagogical, technical, and organizational.Focus of the article is on pedagogical challenges.', ' Virtual Worlds are networked environments that look like the physical world, and create a sense ofplace for the person communicating, navigating, and doing things in the virtual world. Virtual worlds havetraditionally been developed as games, in fact, most virtual worlds today are games. A virtual campus hasbeen developed in the Architecture Faculty at the University of Sydney that is based on some of the conceptsof virtual worlds. The virtual campus is a place on the internet where students can go to take courses, meetwith academic staff, and communicate with other students. The development of the virtual campus has beeninfluenced by research in design science and is based on the conceptual metaphor of architectural design. Thedesign of the virtual campus is considered at three levels: the implementation level, the representation level,and the interface level. Identifying these levels provides a basis for the design of virtual worlds forprofessional and educational environments. The consideration of the representation level results in aconsistent use of a conceptual metaphor so that a person in the virtual campus can make use of the facilitiesin an intuitive manner.', ' “Knowledge Building” is a theory of learning, which emphasizes the collaborative construction of knowledge by a group of learners. Students develop their understanding through sustained inquiry that pursues collective goals of understanding; it is driven by student questions and explanations, in self-directed small groups. Although it can be practiced without computer support, computer software such as Knowledge Forum™ is designed to support such collaborative learning. “Widgets” are software user interface elements that display information and allow the user to manipulate the information display or to accomplish some task. This paper suggests specific classes of widgets that might help learners better attain knowledge building objectives, by distinguishing between the substance of knowledge building and the “meta-communication” which surrounds its development. Widgets designed according to knowledge building principles may help facilitate and articulate this meta-communication component of knowledge building. This is particularly so in distance learning, where the meta-communication usually cannot occur outside the system, as it could in a face to face environment. ', ' The theory of situated learning emphasizes the importance of authentic learning contexts and the central role of social interaction. In the light of this theory and based on our previous experience, we propose an approach for the development of context-based virtual learning environments. These are virtual worlds, which the learners themselves can create and modify. They therefore provide a customized learning context in which all learning processes and communications between learners can be situated. The characteristics of our approach are: the use of perceptual metaphors, the flexible combination of these metaphors within the learning environment, and the support for awareness of the context and the social interaction within it. Collaborative hypermedia technology is used to construct and to represent places and information in the environment and then to navigate within it. The prototype system provides rich and flexible learning contexts and supports various forms of social interaction for communities of practice. ', ' Collaboration is widely regarded as beneficial for learning. Collaboration is the mutual engagement of participants in a coordinated effort to solve a problem together. It has been conclusively argued that a focus on the process of collaboration is necessary in order to understand the value of working together with peers for learning.  ', ' This paper reports on how a mathematical knowledge-building community was used to facilitatechanges to a group of preservice teachers’ conceptions of learning mathematics.', ' The design of a web-based, networked learning environment, Future Learning Environment (FLE-Tools) embodies a model of progressive inquiry. In this paper, we introduce the progressive inquiry model and describe how different modules of FLE-Tools are designed to facilitate participation in this kind of inquiry. Results of a pilot experiment of using FLE-Tools in higher education are presented. The study was based on an analysis of 125 messages posted by thirteen university students to the FLE-Tools database. The results indicated that the course provided positive evidence for an integration of progressive inquiry and online discussion. The pedagogical and design challenges with which we are currently struggling are discussed.  ', ' Designing clinical trials is a complex, ill-structured task. Medical students are equipped neither with relevant experience nor appropriate schemas to effectively design these experiments. Providing novice learners with real-world experiences are not always feasible due to safety, time, and cost. However, simulated experimental design environments can make these experiences possible. Computer models can promote new ways of thinking, facilitate multiple representation of problems, model the inquiry process, and provide explicit external representations. The Oncology Thinking Cap is one such modeling environment that provides students with experiences in designing and simulated clinical trials. In this paper, we present a case study of a group of fourth year medical students working collaboratively at designing Phase II clinical trials to test a cancer drug, Pittamycin. The trials were designed with a special interface that served to promote task-centered discussion and the construction of a shared problem space. The students became aware of the factors involved at this complex task and used the feedback to revise their understanding. ', ' Computer-supported cooperative learning presents challenges for evaluation methodology: Learning events and learning outcomes are dispersed in time and space, making causal relationships difficult to identify. We are developing techniques to address these challenges including systematic sampling, collation of multiple evaluation methods and data, and the use of collaborative critical incidents. In this paper we overview and discuss this emerging methodology. ', ' There is evidence that technology has played a role in transforming classrooms into places wherestudents are actively constructing knowledge and where teachers structure learning resources to facilitatediscovery, problem-solving, and collaboration. In our research, we consider the roles of two processes thatuse technology to support a project approach to learning using multimedia: creating cycles of studentimagination and production and supporting well-developed student collaboration. Our paper examines howtechnology and pedagogy work together in a fourth-fifth grade classroom taught by the fourth author tosupport student imagination, production, and collaboration and explores mechanisms that relate thesecharacteristics to the building of student identities as members in a community of practice.', ' A goal of cooperative learning is the construction of shared knowledge. Shared knowledge represents the common understanding of a group of individuals with respect to the content domain; the active construction of shared knowledge enhances acquisition and retention. Two requirements have to be met during the construction process: First, shared knowledge should be represented explicitely; second, the participants’ multiple perspectives need to be integrated. We focus on the second aspect, called knowledge negotiation, by which the learners’ common understanding is construed. However, common understanding comes in degrees. We provide a theoretical perspective for the negotiation process and propose a quantification of shared knowledge, called the degree of agreement (degreement). Finally, we discuss how a learning environment for distributed learners can support the process of cooperative knowledge construction. ', ' In this paper we will discuss the design of a web based interactive learning environment. We will focus on the cognitive and collaborative tools that we are developing for students learning at a distance. We have adopted a constructivist, problem based approach for our design. An essential element of making this approach work is to integrate the individual and collaborative learning as well as the affordances and scaffolding provided by the different tools. We will discuss the design principles, the tools and the framework for integrating individual and collaborative learning. ', ' Educators are increasingly seeking opportunities to engage their students in active learning through authentic experiences. These authentic curricula, however, often require students to communicate with their peers to a degree that is difficult to achieve within the rigid structure of most schools. This paper addresses the hopes and fears of three teachers’ experience integrating collaborative software to support approximately 370 students in their efforts to communicate and collaborate within the competitive context of a legislative role-playing simulation. Following a brief overview of the design, the paper address the teachers’ fears, hopes, and remaining challenges. ', ' Interactive simulations hold great potential as a communication vehicle capable of improving the usefulness of technology in education. While some benefit can be gained by simply using pre-built simulations, learners benefit most from designing all or at least some aspects of their own simulations. The challenge is to enable this design-as-learning activity without turning students into programmers. A component-based approach cannot only simplify the design of interactive simulations but at the same time serves as collaboration-enabling technology connecting students, teachers, publishers, and researchers. A general framework called the Use & Design Spectrum is introduced to conceptualize collaboration issues of simulation use and design. The AgentSheets simulation-authoring tool is used to provide specific examples of collaborations.  ', ' This paper presents results of a study of middle school teachers using a prototype Macintosh version of CSILE to help create a knowledge-building community. The study, involving middle schools in two school districts in the Southwest United States, provided teachers with training and technical support in the use of the CSILE over a period of one semester.  ', ' This paper describes a collaborative university seminar, CollabU, involving five North-Americanuniversities in its first implementation in the Winter of 1999. In this report we emphasize the design process,the role of reflective practice, and the implications of the seminar for understanding emergingtransformations in university learning, teaching, and scholarship.', ' The Maryland Electronic Learning Community (MELC) is part of the Baltimore Learning Community, a Challenge Grant project funded by the U.S. Department of Education. Created as a partnership between the Baltimore City Public Schools, the University of Maryland, and corporate and public sponsors, MELC was designed to investigate how an electronic learning community could be created around the development and use of a multimedia digital library for teacher-generated lesson plans and activities. In addition to audio, video, image, text, and web resources available in the library, multiple communications technologies (i.e., a community web site, email, a threaded discussion board, and distance learning laboratories) have supported collaboration and interaction among the teacher and university participants. In this paper we present a preliminary analysis of the impact of these technologies on teacher interaction and technology use. We find a substantial level of teacher communication and collaboration across media and we look for evidence that the multiple channels of interaction facilitate teacherís professional development and increasing comfort with technology.  ', ' Increasing numbers of on-line venues for learning and engagement are emerging as virtual spaces become more accessible and commonplace. As analysts, we seek ways of talking about these spaces through a common language for understanding their organization and the nature of the interactions within them. This paper draws on a framework presented by Mynatt, et al., (1998) which provides a lens for viewing on-line community as a set of affordances. I apply this framework in a virtual educational setting, and conclude with a discussion of its applicability as a lens through which to analyze virtual community. ', ' Collaborative fantasy play and storytelling serve an important role in preschool children’s development. Making up characters and telling stories are activities through which children make sense of and test their hypotheses about the world. While computers are increasingly present to support young children’s collaboration in school tasks, there is a lack of computational systems to support children’s voice in this kind of important collaborative activity. ', ' TAPPED IN is an on-line teacher professional development (TPD) research testbed designed to meet the needs of a large and diverse community of education professionals. The MOO technology that supports the testbed has demonstrated sustainability, usability, desirability, and utility across a wide-rage of activities and users. However, we are quickly coming up against technology scaling and integration issues as our community grows and demands new collaborative capabilities emerging on the Internet. Informed by our experience with TAPPED IN and reviews of related work, we are developing a new online \"community-ware\" technology called MEOW (Multi-user Educational Online Workspace) which can scale to handle large virtual communities. Under development in Java and related frameworks, MEOW introduces the concepts of persons, places, and things in a way intended to bind together many existing and emerging Internet services (e.g., web, email, ftp, search, recommendation) that are useful to a virtual community. Our goal is for MEOW to become a flexible, powerful, yet inexpensive platform for all forms of educational research and practice on the Internet. We invite others to join TAPPED IN and help us design the social spaces and technology to address the implications of online communities. ', ' This paper reports on design research for an on-line performance support system that provides case-based support for teaching project-based science curricula. The goal of the system is to provide teachers using PBS curricula with access to help in the form of examples of the enacted curriculum, answer common questions, and support for key teaching tasks. ', '  We are pursuing the notion of a Team Tutoring System, an intelligent tutoring system that monitors and manages teams of students as they collaborate synchronously and remotely to solve extended, distributed, multi-step problems. Our system, named Algebra Jam, provides opportunities for each team member to take on a variety of roles in order to come to know the domain from a variety of perspectives.  To do this, we are defining a typology of collaborative problem solving roles, reifying these roles at the problem solving interface, and accumulating evidence about individual behavior and group problem solving performance in a Bayesian inference network. ', ' Scientific visualization tools render quantitative data into visual representations that can be analyzed and manipulated by students. But certain problems require more qualitative, observational data that cannot be easily represented with current visualization software. This paper describes an approach to using photographs and video as a primary data source for observational inquiry. We describe a framework for students to collaborate around photographs and video, collaboration that leads to inquiry and the development of explanatory models. We also describe two of our learning environments to illustrate how students can begin to develop predictive theories from image data. ', ' We report on set of studies conducted over two years involving over 1000 students at two universities. The main study compares three conditions: conventional classroom lecture, a face-to-face collaborative learning technique called Tutored Video Instruction (TVI), and the virtual-world counterpart of TVI, Distributed Tutored Video Instruction (DTVI). The main study involved over 700 students in 6 courses. When using final course grade as an outcome measure, it has been previously established that TVI students outperform lecture students. Therefore the comparison of interest for us is between DTVI and TVI: would the audio and video technology used to support a distributed group enable DTVI students to achieve the higher grades attainable in TVI? We found no statistical difference between the grades of the DTVI and TVI students, and both groups outperformed the lecture students.  ', ' This paper will describe the development of different forms of language learning via e-mail withstudents on the BA German course at Bolton Institute of H.E, U.K. It will show how three different projectsusing the medium of e-mail have facilitated autonomous language learning, inter-cultural learning in aEuropean context and ultimately if and how technology has brought students from Germany and the UKcloser together in a shrinking world. It will outline the principle features of language learning autonomy,which is understood not to be a matter-of-fact state that learners reach once and for all, but one they have tokeep working towards. It is thus the aim of instruction to provide learning scenarios that will foster languagelearning autonomy. I will put forward the view that collaborative group work via e-mail can provide such alanguage learning context. The paper will be presented with a view to outlining problems, pitfalls and successstories and to giving advise to other individuals and institutions who are wishing to implement similarprojects and also to generate discussion about using the medium of E-mail to facilitate learner autonomythrough collaboration.', ' Networked computers and methods of distance learning are increasingly being used to meet the growing educational need for lifelong learning on flexible conditions. This paper reports on a cross-disciplinary and international collaboration between two web-based courses, which - each in their way - mirror an attempt to meet this need for flexibility in education: a Danish Distributed CSCL course from the Humanities on how to design teaching and learning in pedagogically appropriate ways using ICT-technology (i.e. the whole research area of CSCL), and an American mixed-mode CSCL course (on-campus and web-delivered) from the Sciences on global environmental issues.  ', ' Among the most common form of collaborative discourse in middle school science classrooms is the carefully planned laboratory investigation, where groups of students follow prescribed procedures in order to reproduce and measure some scientifically explainable event. While there are clear pedagogical benefits to replicating scientific processes in a controlled classroom setting, students often have difficulty comprehending how such phenomena manifest on larger scales and connecting their lab results to the real world. The WorldWatcher data visualization software adds a novel dimension to classroom investigations by allowing students to investigate and discuss global climate phenomena within a globally situated geographic context. This paper will discuss the design of an integrated classroom curricular unit on global warming in which WorldWatcher activities and traditional classroom labs complement each other in order to support student collaboration in classroom science investigations. Based on analyses of students collaborating in pairs and in whole-class discussions, we will argue that our two-pronged approach to curriculum design represents an effective framework for introducing innovative computer-supported inquiry tools in urban middle school science classrooms while remaining sensitive to the existing practices of teachers and students in these contexts. ', ' A number of software environments have been developed as media to support collaborative knowledge building, typically featuring a Web-based threaded discussion facility. We have recently developed such a system, known as WebGuide. The distinctive feature of this system is support for structuring collaboration and knowledge construction with personal, group and comparison perspectives. While piloting WebGuide in a middle school classroom and a graduate seminar, we encountered a variety of issues related to both software design and classroom practices. Some of these issues are common to experiences with similar systems and some have to do specifically with support for perspectives. In this paper we review seven of the major issues encountered with an eye toward suggestions for future work. ', ' Over the past decade or so, a number of software environments have been created to support students engaged in collaborative investigations in science (e.g., Belvedere, CoVis, CSILE, SenseMaker, and WebCamile). These environments have used a variety of representations for recording information such as alternate hypotheses, empirical observations, and evidential relations (e.g., node-link graphs, structured lists, and containers). There are both empirical and theoretical reasons to believe that the expressive constraints imposed by a representation and the information (or lack of information) that a representation makes salient may have important effects on students’ discourse during collaborative learning. However, to date no systematic study has been undertaken to explore possible effects. This paper outlines a research agenda to address this need; provides theoretically motivated predictions; and reports initial results from a pilot study. Students worked together in groups of two on hypertext-based \"science challenge\" problems. Two groups used each of free text (MS Word), matrix (Excel) or graph (Belvedere) representations of evidence, for a total of six groups. Analysis of discourse transcripts suggests that these representations have quite different effects on the extent to which students discuss evidential relations. ', ' A synchronous editing system for creating a wall newspaper collaboratively by using local area networks has been developed and tested. This educational system is intended to foster writing skills through a collaborative learning process that stimulates intensive interaction among learners who edit the same document. It is designed to encourage the writer’s awareness of readers and intensive interaction among learners. It has four characteristics: (1) learners are informed when someone else is following their writing process on their screen; (2) learners can instantly see what other learners are writing and revising; (3) the whole newspaper is always displayed; and (4) learners can see which parts of the newspaper other learners are writing and refer to their editing. The authors conducted experiments with the editing system in an elementary school. And the results indicate that (1) students interacted and collaborated well in the writing process; (2) they revised articles repeatedly through interacting with one another; and (3) the system supported the collaborative writing process. ', ' We have designed and developed technologies to make it simpler for teachers and students to take educational advantage of the WWW for collaborative project-based learning. Recognizing that technologies alone are insufficient to effect educational change, we have also directed considerable effort toward working with teachers to construct principled understanding of what supports are required to make effective use of our technologies–a \"technology of use.\" This paper describes the technology we have provided for teachers to support collaborative project-based learning, and through examples of one teacher’s experiences with three Zebu projects we illustrate the needs and challenges in supporting more effective use. Building on what we have learned about supporting teachers in designing, planning, and implementing project structures that will support students in engaging in collaborative project-based learning, we have been working towards the design of a technology of use. This technology of use includes a representational scheme for helping teachers to portray, analyze, plan, design, share, and implement collaborative projects.  ', ' This article reports on three studies that involved undergraduate students collaboratively working on authentic discussion tasks in synchronous and asynchronous Computer Mediated Communication systems (Netmeeting, Belvédère, Allaire Forums). The purposes of the assignments were respectively to develop insight and understanding in a theoretical framework, to co-construct meaningful didactics for a computer based training program and to develop insight and understanding in educational theories in relation to technology. To examine whether the use of the CMC systems could meet these ends, students’ dialogues are characterised in terms of their constructive and argumentative contributions and by their focus on the meaning and application of concepts. In addition, we compare different forms of support, from peer coaching synchronous discussions, offering graphical support at the interface to reflective moderation in asynchronous discussions. Although we compare different systems and assignments, the interplay between focused argumentation and constructive contributions allows us to analyse and compare interaction and learning in different CMC systems, with and without forms of pedagogical support. ', ' This paper describes experiences of youth and their mentors with authentic problem solving in an Internet-based Shared Environment for Expeditions (iExpeditions). The key questions examined are in what ways and to what extent do youth become engaged in an Expedition. First we examine parentsí attitudes toward the iExpeditions project, and youthís motivation for these online activities. Then we present the design for youthsí first two-weeks of activities and then the reality of what occurred. After that, we present results of an active group of fourteen youth and analyze why they were more engaged than others were. We describe four cases from this group to further explore this question. Our discussion summarizes youthsí status of participation as a whole, factors that have affected youthsí engagement, and what we should do to ensure a good startup for the second round of the project.  ', ' This paper describes VisArt, a collaborative telelearning scenario aimed at teacher training. Students at three educational institutions in Norway collaborated at a distance through TeamWave Workplace to design a learning activity for some subject of their choice. At the University of Bergen, VisArt was part of a graduate course assignment where the students had to participate in VisArt and write a report reflecting on their participation from a theoretical perspective. Salomon’s ideas on genuine interdependence and Gutwin et al.’s notions of awareness formed the foundation for the student’s theoretical reflection. This paper describes the VisArt scenario, the evaluation studies being carried out within the DoCTA project, and summarises the student’s own theoretical reflections. ', ' This project brings together two lines of researchóthe study of complex dynamic systems and the use of participatory simulations as a powerful way into systems modelingóboth of which can be enabled and advanced through emerging network technologies. The study of dynamic systems stands as a new form of literacy for all.. Participatory Simulations Activities can support new forms of classroom interaction and can serve to catalyze the engagement with dynamic systems modeling as a core feature of the education of all students. To accomplish these goals, we introduce a new architecture, HubNet. HubNet is an open client-server architecture, which enables many users at the \"Nodes\" (currently TI graphing calculators) to control the behavior of individual objects or agents and to view the aggregated results on a central computer known as the Hub. This network of nodes is integrated with a powerful suite of modeling, analysis and display tools that together give both the capacity to \"fly’ the system in intuitive mode, to reflect on the emergent result of their simulation and, also, to encode their strategies as rules which the system can then run independently. The HubNet system is being used in several middle and secondary classrooms. An illustrative example of classroom use is presented.

The WebCenter provides a suite of groupware tools for the use of Campus Program participants. The WebCenter uses two analysis systems to act as social agents to stimulate activity. First, a collaborative filtering system is used to encourage national and cross-disciplinary collaboration between scholars of teaching and learning. Second, an automated peer-review and invitation system, based on the model of a consensus journal, is being developed for three purposes: to support the development of national consensus on the criteria for assessing the scholarship of teaching and learning, to stimulate the production of scholarship meeting these criteria, and to lend credibility to scholarship published on the WebCenter.  ', ' This paper examines the concept of community relative to CSCL networks. Starting from the point of view that a learning community is a group of individuals who engage in discourse for the purpose of advancing the knowledge of a collective, I suggest that these communities are held together by four cohesion factors; namely, function, identity, discursive participation, and shared values. An examination of learning communities suggests that students’ knowledge building should improve if CSCL designs attend to, and support, each of the cohesive factors. ', ' This paper describes an analytic framework based on the methods of social network analysis pioneered by Nieminen (1974) and Freeman (1978/79) and used by structural anthropologists (e.g., Hage and Harary, 1996). It extends the methodology for use in evaluating computer-mediated communication in small groups and analyzes a sample dataset drawn from synchronous chat room interaction of five adults involved in a process of decision-making. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible applications of social network analysis to computer-supported learning, and limitations.
