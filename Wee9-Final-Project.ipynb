mitigating  system based  frustration  is  important  within  computer based  learning contexts   in  two  experimental  studies   students  answered  online  survey  items  and  were confronted  by  a  frustrating  obstacle—an  error  message  pop up  window  that  blocked  them from answering the items  in the first study   survey sam   an animated interface agent was present throughout the survey  and at the end delivered an affective message  apologetic or empathetic   or  remained  silent   results  revealed  that  the  presence  of  either  message  led students  to  attribute  the

discourse that occurred in these two classrooms  i first identify six distinct discourse structures that were used as building blocks for talking about students  solutions to mathematical problems  i also identify three broad patterns in the ways these structures were used to define interactions in the classrooms  these patterns vary in the level of complexity from getting  discourse  started  to

argumentation can provide students and teachers with opportunities to use evidence to make sense of the phenomena being studied and to engage in central practices of the scientific community  we posit that fostering the practice of argumentation requires transforming classroom interactions in order to create a need for students to attend to each other s claims and evidence  this paper examines the enactment of a 7th grade ecology unit created to generate this need and support these discussions  our analyses of the student discussions show students moving beyond typical classroom interactions in order to understand the ways in which their claims differ and to evaluate one another s claims  in light of the evidence  thus  we conclude that this approach of creating a need and supporting students as they attend to and critically evaluate one another s  claims  and  evidence  appears  to  be  a  promising  strategy  for  fostering  scientific argumentation  ', ' we introduce a model of

2004    and  the  thinkertools project   white   1995    however   one  of  the  greatest  challenges  facing  the  implementation  of  such  models  is  the change process that teachers and their students must move through  bielaczyc   collins  in press    that is  many of these new educational models require a shift in classroom norms and practices   this shift can take multiple forms  including  a  teachers who are new to a given model learning to shift their pedagogy and the type of culture they create within their classrooms  or  b  cases where teachers are more experienced with the model  yet still need to support each new student cohort in shifting from their prior enculturation to that of the model   we are interested in how teachers support such a progression from where their students are initially to the goal state set forth in a new educational model  how can teachers help students conceptualize knowledge and learning in new ways   what are the challenges   are there particular trajectories carved out by such shifts  ', '  this  study  examined  the  ways  in  which  two  urban  elementary  school  teachers integrated  laptops  in  their  instructional

oriented and efficiency oriented activities might promote optimal learning   this proposal describes two tests of this claim—one in an individual context  the other in a collaborative context   the hope is that the innovation efficiency framework may characterize optimal learning and instruction methods both for individuals and groups  ', ' stokes  1997  has argued that research projects can be described by their contributions to  theoretical  understanding  and  the  solution  of  practical  problems   building  on  this  model  scholars  have  suggested  that  the  learning  sciences  should  focus   use inspired  basic  research   with this move has come a focus on projects with the potential to create systemic change rather than  naturalistic  studies  of  learning  in  context  and  design  research  to  develop  innovative interventions  we argue that this is based on a misreading history  and is counter productive for learning science research  to make this case  we use latour s  1983  study of pasteur to suggest an alternative model for research based transformation of education  by way of illustration  we use a brief example of a research project to ground a discussion of the broader implications of this alternative conceptualization of the process of learning sciences research  ']\n"
